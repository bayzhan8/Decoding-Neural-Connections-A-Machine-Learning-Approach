# Abstract
In this study, our team explores neural connectivity using logistic regression, balanced random forest, Gaussian naive Bayes, and gradient boosting approaches. Utilizing the MICrONS dataset from the visual cortex of mice, we predict axonal-dendritic conversions to synapses in cortical pyramidal neurons. Emphasizing balanced accuracy metrics in the Kaggle competition, we tackle class imbalance and implement meticulous feature engineering. The report outlines our technical strategy, encompassing preprocessing, model selection, and creative aspects of our methodology. As we present our findings, we reflect on the competition's challenges and breakthroughs, underscoring the potential impact of our machine learning innovations on advancing neuroscience's understanding of neural connections. Our contributions include engineered features and a notable 78.8% accuracy.
